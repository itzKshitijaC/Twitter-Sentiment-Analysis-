# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning 📊 

# Objective 🔍
### Build, train, test, and deploy an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to predict sentiment from thousands of tweets. Sentiment prediction involves understanding people's feelings about a product or service.

# Tools 🔨
## Anaconda, Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Practical Real-World Application ⭐
### AI-ML sentiment analysis tools empower companies to automatically predict whether their customers are happy. The process could be done automatically without humans manually reviewing thousands of tweets/reviews.

# Data 🔡
## Inputs:
- Twitter tweets (text data)
## Output:
- Sentiment (0 or 1)

# Background 👇🏻
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) works by converting words(text) into numbers
- These numbers are then used to train an AI/ML model to make predictions.
- Predictions could be sentiments inferred from social media posts and product reviews.
- AI/ML-based sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to predict whether their customers are happy or not automatically.
- The process could be done automatically without humans manually reviewing thousands of tweets and customer reviews.
- In this case study, we will analyze thousands of Twitter tweets to predict people's sentiments.

# Project Workflow 🌊

1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case

2: Import libraries and datasets

3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

4: Perform Data Cleaning

5: Visualize Cleaned Datasets

6: Prepare the data by applying a count vectorizer

7: Train a Naive Bayes Classifier

8: Assess trained model performance


# Conclusion 🔚
In this NLP-based sentiment analysis project, I learned to preprocess Twitter data, extract features using TF-IDF, and implement machine learning models for sentiment classification. Key skills included handling imbalanced data, evaluating models with accuracy and F1-score, and applying sentiment analysis to understand public opinion and customer feedback. This hands-on experience solidified my ability to use NLP for real-world sentiment analysis
