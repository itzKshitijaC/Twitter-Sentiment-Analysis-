# Objective 🔍
### Develop a machine learning model to analyze and classify the sentiment of Twitter posts, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral, to gain insights into public opinion on various topics.

# Methodology ⭐
In the first step, we will collect Twitter data.
After collecting the data, we will preprocess it.
Once preprocessed, we will use the scikit-learn library to split our data into training and testing sets.
After the train-test split, we will feed our training data to the Logistic Regression model for tweet classification.
Once our Logistic Regression model is trained, we will test its accuracy using the test data.
